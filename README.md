# 🎮 Balloon Shield: Precision Protection Game

**A high-performance, physics-based precision game built with Next.js and Canvas 2D**

*Developed as a showcase of advanced web game development techniques, real-time physics simulation, and performance optimization.*

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

Balloon Shield is a minimalist, precision-focused arcade game that challenges players to protect a fragile ascending balloon using only a mouse-controlled shield. What appears simple on the surface demonstrates sophisticated engineering: real-time physics simulation, collision detection algorithms, and performance-optimized rendering—all running at 60 FPS in the browser.

### **Core Challenge**
- **One Input**: Mouse-controlled shield with subtle gravitational mechanics
- **Instant Consequence**: Single collision with the balloon ends the game
- **Pure Focus Loop**: Tension → Precision → Failure → Immediate Retry

## 🚀 **Technical Achievements**

### **Advanced Physics Engine**
- **Custom Physics Implementation**: Built from scratch without external libraries for maximum performance and control
- **Dual Collision Systems**: 
  - Circle-to-circle collision for organic objects (shards, rotors)
  - Circle-to-AABB collision for rectangular obstacles (blocks, sweepers)
- **Gravitational Field Simulation**: Objects experience subtle attraction to the shield using inverse-square law physics
- **Realistic Collision Response**: Mass-based impulse calculations with velocity inheritance
- **Continuous Collision Detection**: Prevents fast-moving objects from tunneling through barriers

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Fixed Timestep Game Loop**: Decoupled physics (120 Hz) from rendering (60 Hz) for consistent gameplay
- **Spatial Optimization**: Efficient broad-phase collision detection for handling dozens of simultaneous objects
- **Memory Management**: Object pooling and cleanup systems prevent memory leaks during extended play

### **Sophisticated Input System**
- **Lerp-based Movement**: Shield follows mouse with configurable easing (0.2-0.35) for natural feel
- **Dual Control Schemes**: Primary mouse control with WASD keyboard fallback
- **Accessibility Features**: Adjustable sensitivity (0.5x-1.5x) and shield size options
