🎮 Balloon Shield: Precision Protection Game
A high-performance, physics-based precision game built with Next.js and Canvas 2D

Developed as a showcase of advanced web game development techniques, real-time physics simulation, and performance optimization.

🎯 Project Overview
Balloon Shield is a minimalist, precision-focused arcade game that challenges players to protect a fragile ascending balloon using only a mouse-controlled shield. What appears simple on the surface demonstrates sophisticated engineering: real-time physics simulation, collision detection algorithms, and performance-optimized rendering—all running at 60 FPS in the browser.

Core Challenge
One Input: Mouse-controlled shield with subtle gravitational mechanics
Instant Consequence: Single collision with the balloon ends the game
Pure Focus Loop: Tension → Precision → Failure → Immediate Retry
🚀 Technical Achievements
Advanced Physics Engine
Custom Physics Implementation: Built from scratch without external libraries for maximum performance and control
Dual Collision Systems:
Circle-to-circle collision for organic objects (shards, rotors)
Circle-to-AABB collision for rectangular obstacles (blocks, sweepers)
Gravitational Field Simulation: Objects experience subtle attraction to the shield using inverse-square law physics
Realistic Collision Response: Mass-based impulse calculations with velocity inheritance
Continuous Collision Detection: Prevents fast-moving objects from tunneling through barriers
Performance Optimization
Fixed Timestep Game Loop: Decoupled physics (120 Hz) from rendering (60 Hz) for consistent gameplay
Spatial Optimization: Efficient broad-phase collision detection for handling dozens of simultaneous objects
Memory Management: Object pooling and cleanup systems prevent memory leaks during extended play
Sophisticated Input System
Lerp-based Movement: Shield follows mouse with configurable easing (0.2-0.35) for natural feel
Dual Control Schemes: Primary mouse control with WASD keyboard fallback
Accessibility Features: Adjustable sensitivity (0.5x-1.5x) and shield size options
🎨 Design Philosophy
Minimalist Aesthetics
Monochromatic Color Palette: High contrast design for maximum clarity
Clean Visual Hierarchy: No distracting elements—pure focus on gameplay
Responsive UI: Seamless scaling across device resolutions
Behavioral Game Design
Immediate Feedback Loop: No friction between failure and retry

Copy
// Optimized circle-vs-AABB collision with penetration depth
private circleVsAABB(cx: number, cy: number, r: number, 
                     ax: number, ay: number, aw: number, ah: number) {
  const closestX = Math.max(ax, Math.min(cx, ax + aw))
  const closestY = Math.max(ay, Math.min(cy, ay + ah))
  
  const dx = cx - closestX
  const dy = cy - closestY
  const distanceSquared = dx * dx + dy * dy
  
  return distanceSquared <= r * r ? {
    penetration: r - Math.sqrt(distanceSquared),
    normal: { x: dx / distance, y: dy / distance }
  } : null
